# Introduction to Cryptocurrency Market Web Application

## Project Overview

Our cryptocurrency market web application aims to provide users with comprehensive and up-to-date information on the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. Designed with a user-friendly interface, this platform offers key market insights and tools to help traders and enthusiasts make informed decisions.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Market Data:** Get up-to-the-minute prices, trends, and historical data for a wide range of cryptocurrencies.
- **Watchlist Functionality:** Easily keep tabs on your favorite cryptocurrencies by adding them to your watchlist.

## APIs Used

- **CoinGecko API:** We use the CoinGecko API to pull in real-time market data such as prices, market caps, and historical trends. It's reliable and updates frequently, so you're always in the know.

## Core Purpose

Our main goal is to keep you informed. This app is all about providing valuable data—it’s not a trading platform, but a powerful information resource to help you understand market dynamics.
